## Overview

AtliQ Grands owns and operates multiple five-star hotels across major cities in India. With over 20 years of experience in the industry, the company has built a reputation for excellence in service, luxury accommodations, and guest satisfaction in both the luxury and business hotel segments.

## Problem Statement

Despite its legacy and scale, AtliQ Grands has recently been losing market share and revenue due to:  
- Aggressive competition from new players in the hospitality sector.  
- Ineffective decision-making stemming from a lack of data-driven strategies.

To address this challenge, the Revenue Management division has decided to leverage Business and Data Intelligence by collaborating with a third-party analytics service provider.

## Project Goal

To design and deliver a comprehensive Hospitality Analytics Dashboard that enables AtliQ Grands to:
- Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) like bookings, occupancy, revenue, and customer ratings.
- Identify underperforming areas across cities, room categories, and booking platforms.
- Uncover actionable insights to reduce cancellations and no-shows.
- Support data-driven strategic decisions to regain market share and boost profitability in both luxury and business hotel segments.

## Tools and Techniques Used

- Power Query for data transformation
- Data modeling using star schema and relationships
- DAX for calculated columns and performance measures
- Created KPIs: RevPAR, ADR, DSRN, Lead Time, etc.
- Applied conditional formatting for visual clarity
- Published dashboard and set up scheduled refresh on Power BI Service
